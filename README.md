# SJPConnect | Veracross Analyzer v2
### Another unofficial project by a SJP student.

--------------------------------------------

# Description

**SJPConnect** is an innovative solution to viewing your grades, GPA, class information, and ratings easily. This project is tailored for St. John's Prep students (other schools using Blackbaud can fork this repo and use it freely under the MIT license), though works for everyone! 

--------------------------------------------

# What is this?

**SJPConnect** is a client and server based site, we use Python to gather information, and the page is served to the user. This repo only contains server code and not the client code. I am planning to use a Bootstrap template for the UI as the backend is more important then focusing on a custom UI. Custom UIs are completely welcome, so if you're interested, I'm excited!

If you're looking for SJPConnect, you should head over to the website (and not the code!) at **<Coming soon!>**
